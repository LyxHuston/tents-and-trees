A lab from school.

Solve a puzzle from a given board according to this set of rules:
 - each row and column must have a certain given number of tents
 - each tree must have a unique tent alongside it (NESW) (two trees may not 'count' the same tent)

This project exceeded greatest speed expectations by a factor of 4285.

Data and output files from school have been removed.  I have never successfully computed a solution to 30x30.
